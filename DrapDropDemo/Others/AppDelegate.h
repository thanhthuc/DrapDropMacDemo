 1.b understand about dragging operation
 2. Question: should base on drap operation or not,
 answer: should base on each view to decide

 base on both, each will decide how dragging icon should look
 4. Understand all case in ticket
 5. Rule for drag and drop enable in all view,
 Why in app have case drap on normal view it make can not drag view => answer: because that view does not register for event drap drop // OR receive event and do not handle it
 6. If parent is ViewController, baseView have receive event or not => answer: lowest layer will receive
